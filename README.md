As a data scientist for an energy company, my current project entails creating a Python-based prediction system using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The purpose is to reliably estimate energy surpluses, especially in areas near renewable energy sources. With a focus on reducing false positives, the system tries to predict surplus conditions at least 24 hours in advance, allowing the company to notify nearby customers and offer them the opportunity to receive free energy during these times. Using historical data from 2000 to the present, this study aims to analyze the feasibility of launching a pilot program in May 2024, assuring a cost-effective and dependable service for the company and its clients.

How to use this code
Assumptoins python3 installed on the system
pip3 also installed if already not with python3
should install numpy,pandas,skilearn and matplotlib 
optimal way if you generate and work in venv
asusmed jupyternotebook would be installed
run every cell for the fresh insights 



Assumptions and Thresholds 
0.2 as the threshold
Depending on the particular devices, weather, location, and users, the ideal threshold for reducing false positives in estimating energy surplus based on wind speed and solar radiation varies.  

wind speed and energy generation
Power must be generated by a wind turbine at various wind speeds. Most turbines have a cut-in speed of 3.4–4 m/s and a cut-out speed of 25 m/s.[2] The power must be restricted if the rated wind speed is exceeded.
remarks regarding the Research Gate applicant
The annual average of solar radiation reaching the uppermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere is around 1361 W/m2. On a clear day, the Sun's rays attenuate as they travel through the atmosphere, reaching a maximum normal surface irradiance of approximately 1000 W/m2 at sea level. One bulb and a fan can be powered by the minimum solar insolation of 100–200 W/m2, which is required to produce electricity. 
I anticipate that there will be enough solar or wind energy available in the summer and fall to reduce the number of false negatives in our prediction model. This supposition stems from the belief that the generation of renewable energy during these seasons will yield a sufficient excess to satisfy demand. As well vice versa in the winters and spring for false postivies
